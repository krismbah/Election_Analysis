# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary

- There were "369,711" votes cast in the election.

    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane

    - Diana DeGette, who received "73.8%" of the vote and "272,892" number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to utilize an existing dataset in order to glean usable information from it.
This set of data was from a congressional election spanning over three counties with three contesting candidates.
An audit of this data is expected to report the total votes, turnout, and winning candidate of the election.

## Challenge Summary
This script can be used to quickly report election data to the general public via the election commission website.
The script can also be modified for other elections in two of many ways:
1. Variables can be changed to track the county or candidate with the lowest turnout or votes.
2. The script can be changed to track candidate votes per county rather than just the whole election.
